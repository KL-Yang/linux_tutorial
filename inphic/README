The Blue LED works, EMAC/USB works, Debian Buster on EMMC works.
U-boot use orangepi-pc-plus.

Actually all can use orangepi-pc-plus, except u-boot memory clock!
Only LED does not work properly! No indication of power up!

Note, for debian need patch up the flash-kernel setting, 
otherwise each time kernel update might break the boot process.
